      Chris Gragg (born June 30, 1990) is a former professional American
      football tight end who played three seasons for the Buffalo Bills of the
      National Football League (NFL). Over 32 career games, Gragg totaled 24
      career receptions with 2 touchdowns. Born in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, Gragg
      played college football for the Arkansas Razorbacks, where he won the 2012
      Cotton Bowl. Gragg was drafted by the Bills in the seventh round of the
      2013 NFL Draft after he performed well at the NFL Scouting Combine. Gragg
      finished the 2013 season with 5 receptions for 53 yards and a touchdown.
      After playing in 2014 for the Bills, in 2015, Gragg set career highs in
      games played, receptions, and receiving yards. Gragg signed with the New
      York Jets in 2017, but did not play in any regular-season games for the
      team after a preseason injury. A Twitter account belonging to Gragg
      described him as "retired" as of December 31, 2019. Gragg's brother, Will,
      played college football for the University of Pittsburgh Panthers. (Full
